The goal of the PhD is to become an increasingly independent researcher, who is comfortable
- Formulating independent scientific questions
- Designing experiments or studies to test hypotheses
- Working with collaborators towards a common goal
- Independently learning new techniques
- Teaching others lab or data analysis techniques
- Presenting results to varied audiences
- Writing scientific papers
- Writing grant proposals

Expectations:
- Attend one-on-one meetings with Sarah
- Mentor undergraduates
- Present at 1-2 conferences per year (after discussion with Sarah)
- Apply to 1-2 external or internal research grant or fellowships per year(after discussion with Sarah).
- Write every workday. In the beginning, you will be writing notes in your lab notebook and notes about papers you read. As soon as you have results, start writing the paper. 
- Write 3 first authored papers
- Contribute to other (1-2) papers as a coauthor (either in the lab or with outside collaborators)
