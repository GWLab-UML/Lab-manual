The goal of the MS is to begin to become an increasingly independent researcher, who is comfortable:
- Formulating independent scientific questions
- Designing experiments or studies to test hypotheses
- Working with collaborators towards a common goal
- Independently learning new techniques
- Teaching others lab or data analysis techniques

Expectations:
- Think for yourself. Do not outsource your learning/thinking to any sort of AI. 
- Attend one-on-one meetings with Sarah, when one or both of us are away, send regular updates by Slack or email. 
- Mentor undergraduates
- Present at 1 conference per year (after discussion with Sarah)
- Apply to 1 external or internal research grant or fellowships per year (after discussion with Sarah).
- Write every workday. In the beginning, you will be writing notes in your lab notebook, draft methods sections, and notes about papers you read. As soon as you have results, start writing the paper. 
- Write 1 first authored paper, submitted to a journal before graduation.
