- Learn new techniques, teach them to others, and document for reproducibliity 
- Teach others field, lab, and data analysis techniques
- Present results to varied audiences
- Write scientific papers

- Write every workday, whether it is fellowships, papers from your phd, science communication, or papers from this postdoc.
- Write 1 first authored paper for every year you are a postdoc.
- Contribute to other papers as a coauthor (1 for every year you are a postdoc)
