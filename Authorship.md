**Authorship**
Author order on journal articles denotes individual contributions to the research and manuscript writing. The first author is generally the person who led the research and writing of the manuscript. The last author is generally the person who oversaw the research, came up with some of the ideas, and contributed second most to writing the manuscript. First author is the most valuable spot for early career individuals (Graduate students, sometimes undergrads, technicians, postdocs), last author is most valuable for later career individuals (PIs, sometimes postdocs). In general, the early career individual who leads the research will be first author and Sarah will be last author. Some work may be done in collaboration with other labs. In such a case, another PI may be last author, and Sarah may be second or second-to-last. Our lab’s contributions and authorship will be discussed at the start of collaborative work, and re-evaluated throughout. Most papers coming out of the lab will have a graduate student or postdoc as first author. 

If a trainee takes on a project but subsequently hands it off to someone else, they likely will lose first authorship to the person they pass it on to, unless co-first-authorship is appropriate. Co-first authorship is used when a second person contributed significantly to the research and manuscript, the person whose name is first should have done more of the work than the co-first author. Middle author order does not really matter, and can be assigned alphabetically unless another mechanism is agreed upon by the group. 

If you leave the lab with unpublished work, you should talk to Sarah about whether you plan to
continue to work with her to write it up, or if the final project write-up and revisions should be reassigned to another lab member. In this case, we will revisit authorship questions to determine whether you will retain first authorship, or if the lab member who completes the publication will become first author. This will depend on how much more needs to be done to get the research into a publishable form.

Discussing authorship at the start of a project is a good start, but things can change! All authorship issues should be discussed openly throughout the project, as projects can take unexpected turns, labor distributions can shift and new collaborations can enhance our work. 

Please feel free to bring up questions about authorship with Sarah at any time if you’re not sure of your authorship status on a project or want to challenge it.

- Conducting the majority (>50%) of an activity
- Troubleshooting and developing all protocols in a given category
- Intellectually driving a category (coming up with hypotheses and testing them, designing an experiment, determining how to analyze data and what analyses are most important)
