**Harrassment and discrimination**

Harassment and discrimination will not be tolerated in our lab. Every lab member must abide by the Umass Lowell policies on harassment and discrimination, found here: https://www.umassp.edu/sites/default/files/guidelines/HR-Internal-07%20Non-Discrimination%20and%20Harassment%20Complaint%20Procedures%20and%20Guidelines.pdf with more resources here: https://www.uml.edu/hr/equal/guidelines-procedures/#university-of-massachusetts-lowell-nondiscrimination-guidelines. Please read these policies now.

Sarah is committed to ensuring the lab is a safe, friendly and accepting environment for everyone. We will not tolerate any verbal or physical harassment for any reason. Racism, sexism, or discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, or religion will not be tolerated. We will not tolerate intimidation, stalking, following, unwanted photography or video recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

If you feel you are being harassed or discriminated against, or notice someone else being harassed, please alert Sarah immediately. If Sarah is the cause of your concern, please reach out to the Biology department chair (Pete Gaines), or another trusted faculty member. Allegations of harassment will be handled swiftly and if confirmed will result in expulsion from the lab. 


**Research ethics**
The lab is committed to ensuring research integrity and takes a hard line on research misconduct. Fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism are not tolerated.  If you are feeling like your work doesnâ€™t measure up to others around you or you need to publish more, publish faster, or publish in higher impact journals, reach out and talk to Sarah. These feelings are normal, and something everyone experiences at various stages in their career, but it is NEVER an excuse to cheat. Allegations of misconduct will be handled swiftly and if confirmed will result in expulsion from the lab.

**Data management and reproducibility**

**Samples**: 
Keep track of all samples in a csv that includes information on the storage method, storage location, and when the sample has been used completely. Upload csv to appropriate lab GitHub. 

**Lab process:** 
Use an electronic lab notebook that is accessible by Sarah and can be shared with others in the lab (either google docs or obsidian + github). If you prefer to use a physical notebook in lab, all information must be transferred to an electronic format at the end of the day. 

Write out new protocols, annotate old protocols, and upload all versions to the lab's GitHub. 

**Code and analysis**:
All code should be annotated, version-controlled, and archived in GitHub prior to publication. After publication all code should be made public. 


**Data:** 
Data deposition and open access after publication are the norm in this lab. Digital copies or archival access of all data with proper written descriptions (metadata) is required. I will not share your unpublished data without your explicit permission. 

All data should be backed up to an external hard drive and to GitHub if they are of a reasonable size.

All raw sequence data should be uploaded to NCBI SRA. Other data types should be uploaded to the appropriate repositories.

All materials (scripts, lab notebooks, etc) created in the lab are the property of the lab.

**Github**:
- All repositories need to have a readme file that outlines the uses of different scripts or notebooks and the order in which they should be read. When paper is published, readme should also indicate which analyses went into the final paper, wehre raw data is located and where paper is located. 
- When possible upload data to the same folder. 
- Subfolders within repo:
	- Data (when possible)
	- Sequence processing
	- Data analysis
- Commit messages:
	- Active voice and present tense
	- explain change behavior
- Commit everytime you make a significant change, push at the end of every coding session.
