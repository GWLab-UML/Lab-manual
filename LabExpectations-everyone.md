**What you can expect from Sarah**
- Regular one on one meetings
- Response to questions on slack within 24 hours on weekdays
- Support for career/future exploration, support of you as a whole person
- Feedback on all grants/abstracts/fellowship applications that are sent two weeks before deadline. 
- Edits on paper drafts within two weeks (unless other conflicts like fieldwork require a different timeline). 
- Help troubleshooting technical difficulties.
- Support growing your network and introductions to collaborators. 

**Communicate with Sarah**
- Meet with me regularly (biweekly or weekly). When one or both of us are away, send regular updates by Slack or email. 
-  Inform me of your research and course activities, particularly when (or ideally before) you are overwhelmed. 
- Do not struggle in silence, ask for help when you need it! I may know how to fix problems with labwork, data analysis, writing, people, or the university, or at least point you in the right direction.
- Copy me on all written communication with our research collaborators. Let me know if something happens that may cause concern among our collaborators or people outside our research group. 
- Let me know *before* you apply to any fellowships, conferences, workshops, or professional development opportunities. 
- Send me early drafts of papers, abstracts, and proposals. 

**Be a good lab member**
- Respect people. Respect your labmates’ strengths and weaknesses. Respect their religion, culture, beliefs and sexual orientation. Respect differences in working style. 
- Contribute positively to the social dynamic of the lab. Be present, be engaged, and suggest activities that will help us connect. Enthusiasm is contagious; so is apathy. If you notice any conflict arising in the lab, please bring it to my attention (as you see appropriate). 
- You are expected to attend lab meeting and actively participate unless you are away. If you are working remotely, join via Zoom. You are expected to lead at least one lab meeting a semester (everyone). 
- Help labmates when they need it whether it is a hands-on project or providing constructive feedback on an idea or draft (even if you are not on the project). They will do the same for you. Science is a collaborative endeavor, not a competition. 
- New students should consult with more experienced lab mates for advice and help with navigating their way through graduate school as well as on lab policies. Senior students and postdocs should mentor newer students. 
- Be respectful of labmates' time. Before asking questions or bringing forward a problem, please make the effort to research the topic. This way we can use our time together to discuss various ideas or options. 
- Give constructive criticism respectfully. Always try to help someone make their product better, never attack them personally.  
- Show up to your meetings, you do not need to be in at 9 am every day- just show up for your commitments, and work the hours you need to work to get stuff done. 
- Communicate sick days to anyone that you have scheduled meetings with. 
- Post in the lab slack workspace (gignoux-wolfsohnlab.slack.com). 
- Help recruit new lab members. This may be meeting with a prospective, taking them out for meals and outings, and/or corresponding with them electronically. 
- Report broken equipment promptly. Things break, we can get it fixed if we know about it. 
- Add any vacations (>1 day) to lab google calendar, so people know not to bother you
- Add supplies that need to be ordered to the google doc, don't wait until you use the last box of something. 
- Clean up after yourself, participate in monthly lab cleanups. 

**Do good science**
- The perfect is the enemy of the good. Science isn't perfect, do it well and then move on. 
- Correct your mistakes. We all make mistakes. Admit it as soon as you realize it happened. If you’re working in collaboration with others in or outside the lab, let them know ASAP. It’s ok to make mistakes, we will work to correct them and move on.
- Be careful. Science is complicated and technically demanding. Plan ahead. Take your time. Don’t rush. Write out the protocol for yourself. Check if you have reagents. Double check your protocol or analysis with a colleague. If something looks funny, ask someone else to take a look. If you don’t trust a result, repeat it.
- Work the hours you need to work to be most effective. Coming into the lab is great, but is not the same as getting your work done. 

**Engage with the broader research community** 
- Go to colloquium every week. 
- Try to attend lunch or other meeting with the speaker. Even if the topic seems tangential to you, you never know when and in what context you may meet that person again. 
- Consider attending other seminars on campus
- Read. Stay up to date with the literature. Sign up for Google Scholar alerts, subscribe to e-tables of contents, or follow folks on social media who regularly post relevant science.

**Take care of yourself**
- Self-reflect. What is working? What is not? What variables are within your control? What
strengths do you bring to a situation? Where do you need support? Are there specific actions
others could take that would help? 
- Find balance. You should work hard, but also have a life outside of the lab! I don’t expect you
to be in the lab nights and weekends unless necessary for an experiment. 
- Take vacations and time off for health, family reasons, religious observances, etc. You are expected to take holidays and 1-2 additional weeks off per year. 
- Ask for help. If you’re struggling, tell someone (including Sarah).  Your health and happiness are important. It’s ok to go through rough patches in your lab and personal life (we all do), don’t be shy about asking for help.
