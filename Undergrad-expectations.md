Undergraduates are crucial members of the lab community, but being an undergraduate researcher can take a different shape for different people and can (should) shift over time. 

General expectations: 
- Check in with your primary mentor regularly
	- Complete mentoring contracts each semester or summer
	- Tell them if you do not understand what you are doing
	- Ask for more mentorship or guidance if needed
- Work as many hours as you have committed to for that semester/summer. If you find that those hours no longer work for you, be up front and proactive about communicating that to your primary mentor and/or Sarah
- Show up to scheduled meetings
- Attend and contribute to lab meetings as your schedule allows
- Aim to lead one lab meeting a year (usually during the summer)
- Apply for internal funding (Moloney scholarship, RHSA roads to research, Honors fellowship) or external funding (see sheet on google drive) at least once.
- Present at the UML student symposium

Holding other jobs:
We all have different goals, interests, career paths, and it is good to try different things at this point in your life. You are encouraged to apply to and do other opportunities that will advance your career or self in some way (e.g., REUs, internships in other fields and/or labs, study abroad programs, paid premed programs, etc. ). It is ok to simultaneously work in the lab and work somewhere else, however if your other job is purely financial talk to Sarah about increasing your hours in the lab or taking on other jobs that will both pay you and give you experience. 

Expectations during the semester: 
- Be realistic about what you can do given your class schedule. 
- In general undergrads are expected to work a maximum of 5-10 hours per week during the semester. 
- It is ok to take a semester off from the lab, you can start working again any time and still attend lab meetings if it works for you. 

Expectations during the summer: 
- During the summer students are expected to work between 20 and 40 hours per week (talk to Sarah about part time work and see above section about holding other jobs). 
- Attend all lab meetings
- Read scientific papers related to your work

Expectations for undergraduates who want to do a senior thesis or project (whether honors or not). 
- Start working in the lab during your junior year at the latest
- Work at least one full summer in the lab (either after sophomore or Junior year) on an independent project
- Take research for credit both semesters of your senior year
- Be up front if your plans change
